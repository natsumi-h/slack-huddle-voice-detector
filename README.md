# Slack Huddle Voice Detector

A Chrome extension that detects when someone starts speaking in Slack Huddles and sends notifications.

## Motivation

Teams often stay connected in Slack Huddles while working, but usually keep themselves muted. When someone has a question and wants to speak up, team members might miss it without proper notifications. This extension helps by detecting voice activity in Huddles and alerting you when someone starts speaking.

With this extension, you can enjoy background music or other audio while staying connected to your team's Huddle, confident that you'll be notified whenever someone begins to speak.

## Features

- Detects voice activity in Slack Huddles
